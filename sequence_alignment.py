#Pairwise Sequence Alignment 
"""
1. In this file pairwise aligment is performed using Biopython. 
2. Created a Python Script using sys module (to pass arguments from command line).
3. Throughout the script I implemented modular functions to perform each task:
- Aligning sequences 
- Calculating Similarity %
- Calculating gap frequency 
- Finding conserved regions in sequences 
4. Error Handling was done in each function.
5. Comments are added to explain the code.
